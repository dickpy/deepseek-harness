 *
 * `pinnedSessionIds` is the registry-global Session pin set, ordered
 * newest-pin-first. It is deliberately *not* a per-Workspace account: a pin
 * does not move a Session between Workspaces, it only decides which rows lead
 * the group that already owns the Session. So the set never participates in
